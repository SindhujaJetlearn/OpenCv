# Arithmetic Operation on Images:
# Pixel values are directly added / subtarcted for 2 images
# Subtraction of images
# Image Resizing
# Erosion of an image, corners are trimmed in erosion
# Bluring of an image
# Bordering an image
# Reflective Border around an image



















#Bilateral blur
image:
The input image. It should be a 8-bit or 16-bit unsigned integer matrix or a 32-bit floating-point matrix.
d:
The diameter of each pixel neighborhood that is used during filtering. 
If it is non-positive, it is set to 9.
sigmaColor:
Filter sigma in the color space. 
A larger value of the parameter means that farther colors within the pixel neighborhood (see sigmaSpace) will be mixed together, 
resulting in larger areas of semi-equal color.

sigmaSpace:
Filter sigma in the coordinate space. 
A larger value of the parameter means that farther pixels will influence each other as long as their colors are close enough (see sigmaColor). 
When d>0, it specifies the neighborhood size regardless of sigmaSpace. Otherwise, d is proportional to sigmaSpace.
